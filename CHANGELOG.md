- Added dynamic moon light.
- Improved lightmap computation based on the True Darkness mod for Fabric.
- Changed options in config. If you’ve made any changes, you’ll have to apply them again.
- Probably fixed standalone jar builds not being reobfuscated.
- Mod compatibility should be a bit better.
- Updated mod description in mcmod.info.
